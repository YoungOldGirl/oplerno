    %h2 You have $#{@ic.amount} credits
    %br
    Great news, you now have $#{@ic.amount} credits to use in the 
    %a(href='https://enroll.oplerno.com/') Oplerno Marketplace!
    %p
    - if @ic.user.id == @ic.by.id
      One of your friends has used an invitation you created. They will need to complete at least 30% of the course before we credit your account.
      %p
      For you to receive your $#{@ic.amount} toward an Oplerno course, your friend just has to enroll in a course and stay in the course for at least four weeks (we need to make sure your friend is serious about taking the course after all)!
      %p
      You can build up as many $#{@ic.amount} credits toward Oplerno courses as you would like. Remember, they hold no cash value and can only be used toward Oplerno courses.
    %p

    You will receive credits once the class has passed the time for a refund.
